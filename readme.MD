In this project, I am creating a simple resturant site with 3 pages. Each page is a separate Javascript module and bundled with webpacker. The purpose of this project is to practice the module pattern, using NPM and webpacker and using javascript to create and manipulate DOM elements.

This is a Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)
